Email Warmup Service Architecture
Overview
The Email Warmup Service is a standalone platform designed to improve email deliverability by automating the warmup process for email accounts. It integrates with Parakeet by accepting OAuth tokens via API to send and receive emails. The service sends controlled, human-like emails to a pool of warmup addresses, simulates interactions (e.g., opens, replies), and tracks engagement metrics to build sender reputation. It provides analytics to monitor warmup progress and is built to be modular, attachable to any email platform requiring warmup.
User Flow
The user flow outlines how Parakeet and their users interact with the Email Warmup Service to manage and monitor email warmup campaigns. User authentication occurs in the parent platform, which passes OAuth tokens to the warmup service.
1. Token Integration:

   * The external platform authenticates the user and obtains OAuth tokens for their email account(s) (e.g., Gmail, Outlook).
   * The platform sends these tokens to the Email Warmup Service via a secure API endpoint (e.g., /api/accounts/add with token payload).
   * The service validates the tokens and stores them encrypted for email operations.
   2. Account Setup:

      * The external platform specifies the email account(s) to warm up via API, including token details and optional settings (e.g., initial daily email limit, target warmup duration).
      * The service initializes the warmup campaign with a default schedule (e.g., 5 emails/day, increasing gradually).
      3. Warmup Execution:

         * The service automatically sends emails to a pool of warmup addresses (managed internally).
         * Emails mimic human-like behavior (e.g., varied content, typos, friendly tone) using AI-generated templates.
         * The service simulates interactions (e.g., opens, replies) via the warmup pool to boost engagement metrics.
         4. Monitoring and Analytics:

            * The external platform retrieves real-time analytics (e.g., emails sent, opened, replied, warmup score) via API.
            * The service adjusts the daily email limit and warmup level based on engagement (e.g., open rate >50% triggers an increase).
            5. Management:

               * The external platform can pause, resume, or adjust warmup settings (e.g., daily limit, content preferences).
               * Additional email accounts can be added or removed from the warmup campaign.
Functionality
The Email Warmup Service provides the following core functionalities as a standalone service:
               1. Email Account Integration:

                  * Accepts OAuth tokens via API from external platform for major email providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.).
                  * Securely stores encrypted OAuth tokens for sending/receiving emails.
                  * Validates token connectivity and permissions using provider APIs.
                  2. Automated Email Sending:

                     * Sends controlled volumes of emails to a managed pool of warmup addresses.
                     * Uses AI (e.g., OpenAI GPT models) to generate varied, human-like email content (e.g., greetings, follow-ups).
                     * **Includes tracking pixels in emails to monitor opens.
                     3. Engagement Simulation:

                        * Simulates human-like interactions (e.g., opens, replies) via the warmup pool to improve sender reputation.
                        * Uses IMAP to poll for replies from warmup addresses and update engagement metrics.
                        * Adjusts warmup strategy (e.g., daily limit, content type) based on engagement data.
                        4. Analytics:

                           * Tracks metrics: number of emails sent, opened, replied, and current warmup score (0-100).
                           5. Warmup Management:

                              * Allows external platforms to configure warmup settings (e.g., daily limit, schedule, content preferences) via API.
                              * Automatically scales email volume based on engagement and warmup score.

Implementation Notes
                                                * Scalability: Scale Flask/Celery workers based on load. Redis and PostgreSQL can be clustered for high availability.
                                                * Extensibility: Support additional providers (e.g., Yahoo, custom SMTP) by abstracting email sending/receiving logic.
                                                * Testing: Use MailHog/Mailtrap for local testing, pytest for unit/integration tests.
Conclusion
The Email Warmup Service provides a robust, standalone solution for improving email deliverability through automated warmup campaigns. The architecture leverages Flask, Celery, PostgreSQL, and AI-driven content generation to deliver a scalable, secure platform that integrates seamlessly with Parakeet via API. Future enhancements could include A/B testing for email content, multi-provider support, and advanced analytics (e.g., spam score tracking).
