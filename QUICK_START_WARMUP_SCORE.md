# Quick Start Guide - Warmup Score System

## 🎯 What This Does

The new warmup score system gives you a **comprehensive, easy-to-understand score (0-100)** for each email account, telling you:
- ✅ **How good your email reputation is** (with grades A+ to F)
- 📊 **Specific areas to improve** (open rates, replies, spam issues)
- 🚀 **When you're ready to scale up** (with messages like "Ready for takeoff!")

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### 1. Start Your Services

You need 3 terminals running:

**Terminal 1 - Flask App:**
```bash
cd /home/dias/Documents/Projects/email-warmup-poc
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Celery Worker:**
```bash
cd /home/dias/Documents/Projects/email-warmup-poc
source venv/bin/activate
celery -A app.celery_app worker -l info
```

**Terminal 3 - Celery Beat (Scheduler):**
```bash
cd /home/dias/Documents/Projects/email-warmup-poc
source venv/bin/activate
celery -A celery_beat_schedule beat -l info
```

### 2. Verify It's Working

**Option A - View Dashboard:**
```
Open browser: http://localhost:5000/api/analytics/dashboard
```
You should see warmup status messages like "🚀 Ready for takeoff!" next to each account.

**Option B - Test via Terminal:**
```bash
# Test all warmup accounts
python scripts/test_warmup_score.py

# Or test specific account (replace 1 with your account ID)
python scripts/test_warmup_score.py 1
```

**Option C - Check API:**
```bash
# Get detailed score for account 1
curl http://localhost:5000/api/analytics/account/1/warmup-score
```

## 📊 Understanding Your Score

### Score Ranges
- **90-100 (A+):** 🚀 **Ready for takeoff!** Your emails are trusted. Scale up!
- **80-89 (A):** 📈 **Almost ready!** Great progress, keep it up!
- **70-79 (B):** 🌤️ **Good progress!** Some fine-tuning needed.
- **60-69 (C):** ⚠️ **Fair progress.** Review your strategy.
- **50-59 (D):** 🚨 **Poor performance.** Urgent action needed.
- **0-49 (F):** 🛑 **CRITICAL!** Stop and fix issues immediately.

### What Affects Your Score?

1. **Open Rate (40%)** - Are people opening your emails?
   - Target: 60%+ for excellent score
   
2. **Reply Rate (30%)** - Are people engaging with replies?
   - Target: 25%+ for excellent score
   
3. **Phase Progress (20%)** - Are you on track with your warmup schedule?
   - Staying consistent with daily targets is key
   
4. **Spam Rate (10%)** - Are emails landing in spam?
   - Target: Under 2% for excellent score

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Improving Your Score

**If Open Rate is Low (<40%):**
- ✍️ Improve subject lines - make them more engaging
- 🕐 Adjust send times to match recipient activity
- 🎯 Ensure you're sending to engaged recipients

**If Reply Rate is Low (<15%):**
- 💬 Make emails more conversational
- ❓ Include clear questions or CTAs
- 🎯 Personalize content more

**If Spam Rate is High (>5%):**
- 🔒 Check email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- 📝 Review content for spam trigger words
- 👥 Only send to engaged, opted-in recipients

**If Phase Progress is Low:**
- 📅 Stay consistent with daily sending
- ⚖️ Meet your phase targets
- 🔄 Don't skip days

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Scores Not Updating

**Solution 1 - Check Celery is Running:**
```bash
ps aux | grep celery
```
Should show both "celery worker" and "celery beat"

**Solution 2 - Check Logs:**
```bash
# In Celery worker terminal, look for:
"✅ Account warmup@example.com: Score = 89.5 (A)"
```

**Solution 3 - Manual Trigger:**
```bash
python scripts/test_warmup_score.py
```

### Problem: Dashboard Not Showing Status

**Solution 1 - Clear Browser Cache:**
- Press Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

**Solution 2 - Check API Response:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/analytics/dashboard/data | jq '.warmup_accounts[0]'
```
Should include `warmup_status` and `warmup_grade` fields

### Problem: All Scores Are Zero

**Cause:** No email data yet

**Solution:** 
- Wait for emails to be sent
- Ensure email tracking is working (opens/replies)
- Check that `Email` table has data
